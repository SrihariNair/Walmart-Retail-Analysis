**Project Overview**

This project focuses on exploring and analyzing Walmart sales data. It includes comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA), variable transformations, and pushing data into a PostgreSQL database for further SQL querying. The project aims to derive meaningful insights from the sales data, understanding patterns and trends related to products, customer types, sales performance across different times of the day, and more.

**Features**
* Data Cleaning: Standardized and cleaned up sales data for consistency.
* Data Transformation: Added new columns such as time_of_day, day_name, and month_name to enrich the dataset.
* Data Analysis: Performed various SQL queries to extract insights from the data, such as sales performance by time of day, most popular product lines, revenue by month, and customer demographics analysis.
* Database Integration: Utilized PostgreSQL to manage and query the data efficiently.

**SQL Queries**
This project includes a variety of SQL queries used to analyze the dataset:
* Basic Transformations: Adding and updating new columns to enhance data with temporal attributes.
* Aggregation Queries: Computing total sales, average ratings, and revenues by various dimensions (product line, time of day, etc.).
* Analytical Insights: Identifying the most selling product lines, cities with the highest revenue, and average customer ratings by different criteria.
* Customer Analysis: Exploring customer demographics and behavior patterns such as most common customer types and their purchasing trends.

**How to Use**
* Setup Database: Ensure PostgreSQL is set up and configure the connection settings as per your environment.
* Data Preparation: Run the initial data cleaning and transformation scripts to prepare your dataset.
* Execute Queries: Use the provided SQL queries to explore and analyze the data. Modify queries as needed to suit specific analytical needs.

**Dependencies**
* PostgreSQL: For database operations.
* Python (optional): For additional data manipulation and analysis if required.
